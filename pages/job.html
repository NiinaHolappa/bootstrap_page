          I am a calm person and I can fit in many different work environments. I have experience from customer service and I'm good at it, but I don't prefer to work in that field as tightly as I'm doing now. I prefel regular work hours but I would like to have change to work flexitime. My dergee leads to ICT field. Right now I'm most interested in creating web-sites and I would also like to learn more about graphic design. I have learned the basics of JavaScript and I'm currently learning more and more about it. I would also like to learn other programming languages
